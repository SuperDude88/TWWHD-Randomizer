# TWWHD-Randomizer
The Wind Waker HD Randomizer

Currently in early development and still has a lot to figure out. It will use offsets and pattern matching to find the useful values in the files, then use a modified version of FTPiiU Everywhere to load the modified game. Items will be placed with assumed fill and seeds can be shared via config files.

Current to-do list:

Extracting the files from the Wii U and putting them in appropriate folders (on the SD card)

Yaz0 decoding the extracted files

Decoding the RPX

Offsets for more locations and reformatting the list as JSON

Logic and seed generation

Re-encoding the modified files

ASM patches

Replacing the files on the system to load the randomized game
