# TWWHD-Randomizer
A Randomizer for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD

Still needs lots of development before it is useable. Most patches and tweaks are written (save a few important ones), but logic is far from complete.

Current to-do list:
 - A bunch of stuff for item placement
 - Writing and testing seed generation
 - A little more file management testing
 - A few remaining ASM patches and other tweaks
 - GUI/making it usable
