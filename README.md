# TWWHD-Randomizer
The Wind Waker HD Randomizer

Currently in early development and still has a lot to figure out. It will use offsets and pattern matching to find the useful values in the files, then use a modified version of FTPiiU Everywhere to load the modified game. Items will be placed with assumed fill and seeds can be shared via config files.
