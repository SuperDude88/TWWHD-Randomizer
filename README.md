# TWWHD-Randomizer
A Randomizer for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD

Still in relatively early development and has barely touched ASM patches (of which there will be a lot). Current work is focused on compressing/decompressing/dumping/loading game files on the Wii U.

Current to-do list:

Writing the code to dump and replace game files on console (concept proven, code not so much)

Yaz0 decoding the extracted files

Offsets for more locations and reformatting the list as JSON

Logic and some small bits of seed generation

Re-encoding the modified files

ASM patches and other important tweaks
