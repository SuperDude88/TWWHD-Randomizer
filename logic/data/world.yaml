# This file contains the listings for each predefined logical area. Areas can contain
# Events, Locations, and Exits.
#
# Events are logic variables which become true when their requirement string evaluates
# to true and are surrounded with single quotes when used in other logic statements
# (unlike macros which are defined in macros.yaml). It's possible to add new events
# to the logic simply by defining them in an area and then using them in whichever
# logic statements you wish. No modifications to the code are necessary.
#
# Locations are places which can contain randomized items. Adding new locations
# here will require adding them in location_data.yaml as well.
#
# Exits define how the areas of the world graph connect to each other. Each exit
# is a one way connection, so when making new areas remember to define the exit
# connections both ways if applicable. New areas can be defined without having to
# modify the code.
#
# Each dungeon in the world graph is at least defined on a room by room basis
# (although in many cases rooms are split up into multiple parts). This is to
# help simplify glitched logic should anybody ever want to write it, and if
# anybody ever wants to go to the effort of splicing dungeon rooms together,
# that's logically supported as well.
#
# The following logical operators/functions are available for logic statements:
# - and
# - or
# - not
# - count(<number>, <item>)
# - can_access(<area name>)
