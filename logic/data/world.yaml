# This file contains the listings for each predefined logical area. Areas can contain
# Events, Locations, and Exits.
#
# Events are logic variables which become true when their requirement string evaluates
# to true and are surrounded with single quotes when used in other logic statements
# (unlike macros which are defined in macros.yaml). It's possible to add new events
# to the logic simply by defining them in an area and then using them in whichever
# logic statements you wish. No modifications to the code are necessary.
#
# Locations are places which can contain randomized items. Adding new locations
# will require adding them in the code as well.
#
# Exits define how the areas of the world graph connect to each other. Each exit
# is a one way connection, so when making new areas remember to define the exit
# connections both ways if applicable. Adding new areas to the logic will require
# defining them in the code as well.
#
# The following logical operators/functions are available for logic statements:
# - and
# - or
# - not
# - count(<number>, <item>)
# - can_access(<area name>)
