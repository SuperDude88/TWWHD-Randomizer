# Example Plandomizer file. Please read all the insutrctions here so you know
# how to properly create a plandomizer file. To use a plandomizer file for local
# development, put your plandomized locations in the file "plandomizer.yaml" in the
# same directory as this example file (which should be logic/data/plandomizer.yaml in
# the project structure).

# LOCATIONS
# All plandomized locations are defined under a "locations" element and consist
# of the location name followed by a colon(:) and the item name you want placed
# at that location. The following example places Bombs at Windfall Island - Maggie Free Item
# and Power Bracelets at Wind Temple - Wizzrobe Mini Boss. Note that the hyphen(-)
# is important for the YAML format and must always be on the *FIRST ELEMENT* in the plandomizer file
- locations:
      Windfall Island - Maggie Free Item: Bombs
      Wind Temple - Wizzrobe Mini Boss: Power Bracelets

# NAMES
# As a general rule, capitalize the first letter of all item names.
# "Power Bracelets" is okay. "power bracelets" will be unrecognized. For a full
# list of location names, please check out:
# https://github.com/SuperDude88/TWWHD-Randomizer/blob/dev-2/logic/data/location_data.yaml

# PROGRESS_LOCATIONS
# Attempting to place a major item in a non-progression location will give you a
# Plandomizer Error and the seed won't generate.

# RACE_MODE_DUNGEONS
# If you have race mode enabled and place a major item inside a dungeon, then
# that dungeon will automatically be one of the race mode dungeons. For example
# if you have race mode enabled and have the number of race mode dungeons set to 2,
# then placing a Progressive Bow at Earth Temple - Stalfos Mini Boss will automatically
# make Earth Temple one of the two race mode dungeons:
    Earth Temple - Stalfos Mini Boss: Progressive Bow
# If you place major items in more dungeons than you have set as the number of
# dungeons for race mode, you'll get a Plandomizer Error and the seed won't generate.
#
# Additionally, since race mode dungeons are required to have a progress item at their
# boss check, placing a junk item at the boss heart container will force the dungeon
# to *NOT* be one of the selected race mode dungeons.
#
# In the event that you place a progress item in the dungeon AND a junk item on the
# boss heart container, you'll get a Plandomizer Error and the seed won't generate
# if race mode is turned on.

# ENTRANCES
# All plandomized entrances are defined under an "entrances" element and consist
# of the original entrance that you want to change followed by a colon(:) and the
# replacement entrance you want the original connection to go to. The following example
# switches the entrances between Link and Orca's houses on Outset Island. Note that
# when plandomizing entrances, the entrance randomizer setting for the entrances you're attempting
# to plandomize must be turned on. Note that the hyphen(-) in the example is important
# for the YAML format and must always be on the *FIRST ELEMENT* in the plandomizer file
- entrances:
      Outset Island -> Outset Link's House: Outset Orca's House from Outset Island
      Outset Island -> Outset Orca's House: Outset Link's House from Outset Island
# The original entrance must be in the format "<first area> -> <second area>", and
# the replacement entrance must be in the format "<second area> from <first area>".
# The spaces around the arrow and the word "from" are important to include. These
# formats are not interchangable.  If you attempt to randomize entrances
# that don't exist or which aren't supported for shuffling at the current moment,
# then you'll get a plandomizer error.

# STARTING ISLAND
# You can also set the starting island if you want to. For this to apply, you must
# turn on random starting island in the settings. For a list of island names, see
# https://github.com/SuperDude88/TWWHD-Randomizer/blob/dev-2/logic/Area.cpp#L68
- starting island: Five Eye Reef

# MULTIWORLD_PLANDOMIZER (Note: currently multiworld is not an option in the randomizer
# and is not actively being developed, but the filling algorithm was made to support
# multiworld incase it ever happens in the future.)
# If you'd like to plandomize a multiworld seed, then each list of locations and/or
# entrances must be under a "World #" element, with the '#' being the world number
# the locations will be for. For example, if we want place the Telescope at
# Outset Island - Under Link's House in World 1 and the Bait Bag at
# Gale Isle - Sunken Treasure in World 2, then we'd type
- World 1:
      locations:
          Outset Island - Under Link's House: Telescope
  World 2:
      locations:
          Gale Isle - Sunken Treasure: Bait Bag
# Using this format, the item being plandomized will be for the world that the
# location is currently under. If we want to specify the item for a different
# world we can use the "item" and "world" elements to do so. For example, if we want
# to place Bombs for World 1 at World 2's Hyrule Castle - Sword Chamber Chest
# and the Hero's Charm for World 1 at World 2's Ganon's Tower - Maze Chest we would type:
- World 2:
      locations:
          Hyrule Castle - Sword Chamber Chest:
              item: Bombs
              world: 1
          Ganon's Tower - Maze Chest:
              item: Hero's Charm
              world: 1
