# MISC Entrances are those which don't fit into any of the above categories,
# but which are still interesting for entrance randomizer. These are all
# the open-air entrances on the overworld (excluding Hyrule).
#
# MISC_RESTRICTIVE are entrances which mostly lead to dead-ends. When randomizing
# these entrances we want to attempt randomization with the entrance which goes
# *to* the dead-end, not *from* it. This significantly reduces the chances
# of entrance placement failure.
